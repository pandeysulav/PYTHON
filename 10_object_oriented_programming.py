# Why do they do things like this, I never understand and have never ever understood things like this in my life. There have been bad moments of mine too. But I have been trying and will try
# more in the future too. I know that this is getting hard at first but there's no way that I will give up on my dream that I have so high expectations of. This is my childhood dream. I have
# all the requirements to achieve this, but one thing that I know for sure is that I have to be the special one who has the ability to adapt. That is the qualtiy that I need to have overtime.
# Because that is the thing that I feel like is the 'ESSENCE' of coding. Really, the first semester felt hard because nothing was getting inside my head, but now I have everything in order to 
# become a top class AI researcher. I just need to stick to a schedule and keep pushing my limits until and unless I achieve this. My parents have worked so hard for me at this point that I can 
# never ever disappoint them. I have the potential and environment to grow in my life and I should not even think of letting this massive opportunity down. I have to make coding, maths, 
# statistics and curiosity to the level that I can never look back on this at any point of my life. I have the greatest strength and environment that anybody has had in my bloodline and I am 
# the one responsible to keep up for the name 'Pandey'.
