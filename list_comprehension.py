#List comprehensino is the concise way to create lists in Python.
# It is a more readable and efficient way to create lists compared to using loops.

# doubles = [x * 2 for x in range(1,11)]
# triples = [y * 3 for y in range(1,11)]
# squares = [z * z for z in range(1,11)]

# print(doubles)
# print(triples)
# print(squares)

# fruits = ["banana", "apple", "mango", "orange", "kiwi"]
# fruit = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
# fruit = [fruit[0:3] for fruit in fruit]
# print(fruit)

# numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 8]

# positive_nums = [num for num in numbers if num >= 0]
# negative_nums = [num for num in numbers if num < 0]
# even_nums = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
# odd_nums = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]

# print(positive_nums)
# print(negative_nums)
# print(even_nums)
# print(odd_nums)


# grades = [90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

# passing_grades = [grade for grade in grades if grade >= 60]

# print(passing_grades)
