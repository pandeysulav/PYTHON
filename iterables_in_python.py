#Iterables in Python
# An iterable is an object that can return its members one at a time, allowing it to be iterated over in a loop.

# numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# for item in numbers:
#     print(item)

# fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'}

# for fruit in reversed(fruits):
#         print(fruit)


# name = "Python"

# for character in name:
#     print(character, end=" ")


# my_dictionary = {
#     "A":1,
#     "B":2,
#     "C":3,
# }

# for key,value in my_dictionary.items():
#     print(f"{key} = {value}")
